# databases-sql

This repo was made for the Databases module of the Makers bootcamp (week 3). The objectives of this module were to:

- Design a database schema with at least two tables from a specification, including a one-to-many relationship between two tables, and create the schema in a database using SQL.
- Use SQL to query a database to read data from one table or resulting of a join, create new records, update and delete.
- Integrate a relational database to a program by test-driving classes which implement CRUD methods to send SQL queries to a database.
- Explain how your program communicates with the database by creating a sequence diagram.

These objectives were achieved by working through a sequence of exercises and challenges over one week, a full list of which can be found in the original Makers module [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/databases).
