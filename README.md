# databases-sql

This repo contains my solutions for the Databases module of the Makers bootcamp (week three). The objectives I achieved during this module include:
- Design a database schema with at least two tables from a specification, including a one-to-many relationship between two tables, and create the schema in a database using SQL.
- Use SQL to query a database to read data from one table or resulting of a join, create new records, update and delete.
- Integrate a relational database to a program by test-driving classes which implement CRUD methods to send SQL queries to a database.
- Explain how your program communicates with the database by creating a sequence diagram.

My solution to this module's end of week 'Shop Manager Challenge' can be found [here](https://github.com/atcq9876/shop-manager-challenge).
